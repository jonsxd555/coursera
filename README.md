## Introduction
This report describes the approach used to predict the manner in which exercises were performed using accelerometer data. The goal is to predict the `classe` variable using various machine learning models.

## Data Preprocessing
- The data was loaded and cleaned.
- Irrelevant columns were removed, and missing values were handled.
- Feature selection was performed using near-zero variance filtering.

## Model Building
- We trained Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.
- Cross-validation was used to tune the models and estimate out-of-sample error.

## Results
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 0.988
- **GBM Accuracy:** 0.837

## Conclusion
- The Random Forest model outperformed the GBM model.
- The model is ready to be applied to the test set.
